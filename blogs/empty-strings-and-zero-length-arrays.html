    <h1>Empty Strings and Zero-length Arrays: How do We Store... Nothing?</h1>
    <p class="blog__byline">by <a href="/">Biraj</a> on <time datetime="2024-06-15">15th June 2024</time></p>

    <div role="paragraph">
      In high-level languages like Python and JavaScript, we are pretty used to initializing strings and arrays like
      this:
      <pre><code class="code-block">let myStr = ""; // an empty string
let myArr = []; // an empty array</code></pre>

      We're saying that these are empty, which implies they contain zero bytes of data. So we are storing zero-bytes of
      data? Huh? Tf is this paradoxical nonsense?
    </div>

    <h2>Storing Nothing</h2>
    <p>
      An empty array or string doesn't contain any elements or characters, yet it exists. This can feel as paradoxical
      as carrying an invisible suitcase that weighs nothing. But how do we make sense of this? *drumrolls* Actually,
      it's NOT empty.
    </p>

    <h2>Strings: The C Language Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      To unravel this mystery, let's take a trip to the world of C programming. In C, strings are typically handled as
      arrays of characters ending with a <em>null character</em> (<code>'\0'</code>). But what happens when you want an
      empty string?
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create an empty string in C, you are essentially allocating a string that points to a memory location
      that stores the null character. This is akin to reserving a seat at a table for a ghost. The chair is there, the
      place is set, but nobody's coming to dinner. Reminds me of my last date.
    </p>
    <div role="paragraph">
      Here's a simple representation in C:

      <pre><code class="code-block">char emptyString[1] = "";</code></pre>

      In this example, <code>emptyString</code> is an array with a single element (notice the <code>[1]</code>in the
      declaration), which is the null terminator. The length of the string is zero, but the pointer
      <code>emptyString</code> itself is very much real and occupies memory. It's like having an address to an empty
      house.
    </div>
    <div role="paragraph">
      In C, the length of a string is determined by iterating through each character until the null terminator
      (<code>'\0'</code>) is encountered. This is exactly what the <code>strlen()</code> function does. It counts
      characters until it finds the null byte, excluding the terminator itself.

      <blockquote cite="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strlen.3.html">
        The strlen() function calculates the length of the string pointed to by s, excluding the terminating null byte
        (<code>'\0'</code>).
      </blockquote>

      So <code>strlen(emptyString)</code> will start the counter with 0 but immediately reach the null byte, resulting
      in a length of 0.
    </div>

    <h2>Zero-Length Arrays</h2>
    <div role="paragraph">
      In C, arrays are typically fixed in size once declared. So first let's C (ok sorry, see) how we can implement a
      dynamic or growable array of integers using a struct:

      <pre><code class="code-block">struct IntArray {
  int *data;     // pointer to the array's data
  int length;    // current number of elements in the array
  int capacity;  // maximum capacity of the array
};</code></pre>

      Here, <code>IntArray</code> represents a C struct that manages an array of integers. It consists of:
      <ol>
        <li><code>data</code>: A pointer to the array's data (which can dynamically grow).</li>
        <li><code>length</code>: The current number of elements in the array.</li>
        <li>
          <code>capacity</code>: The maximum capacity of the array, indicating how many elements can be stored before
          needing to resize.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional fixed-size arrays, instances of <code>IntArray</code> can dynamically adjust their size as
      elements are added or removed, akin to how arrays work in higher-level languages like Python or JavaScript.
      However, in C, this flexibility comes with added responsibility. Developers must manually manage memory allocation
      and resizing. They need to track the array's length when pushing or popping elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an <code>IntArray</code> is initialized, memory is allocated based on the <code>capacity</code> in bytes, and
      the address of the allocated memory is stored in the <code>data</code> pointer. The <code>length</code> field is
      then set to zero. This process is analogous to what higher-level languages like JavaScript do internally when you
      create an empty array.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <div role="paragraph">
      Knowing that an empty string in C is just a pointer that points to <code>'\0'</code> character feels good.
      Curiosity is reason enough! Here's what I tweeted today:
      <blockquote cite="https://x.com/not_salgaonkar/status/1801878409343082878">
        go underneath those abstractions anon, and you'll experience wonders.
